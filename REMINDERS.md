# Junk Removal Website Improvement Reminders

This file contains a list of tasks and reminders for future enhancements to ensure our junk removal website outperforms competitors and continues to attract customers.

## High-Priority Tasks

- **Create additional location pages:** Following the template of `junk-removal-west-palm-beach.html`, build pages for other key towns in Palm Beach County (e.g., Wellington, Palm Beach Gardens, Loxahatchee, Lake Worth). Include location-specific headings, service area lists, and meta descriptions.
- **Add testimonials and case studies:** Collect customer reviews and success stories to feature on the site. Place them on the homepage and individual service pages to build trust and social proof.
- **Expand service content:** Write detailed pages or blog posts for specific removal types (e.g., appliance removal, furniture disposal, yard waste hauling). Answer questions about pricing, same-day service, and eco-friendly disposal.
- **Optimize page speed:** Compress images (e.g., hero.jpg) and future photos, use modern image formats such as WebP, and minify CSS/JS to improve performance scores.
- **Implement Local SEO:** Ensure each page has LocalBusiness structured data with accurate `areaServed` fields. Create and verify a Google Business Profile and embed Google Map/location details.
- **Add interactive map:** Consider adding a map showing the service coverage area to improve local relevance and user experience.

## Marketing & Growth

- **Set up Facebook/Instagram ad campaigns:** Use the flyer creative and targeted audiences defined earlier. Test different budgets and creative variations. Monitor cost per lead and adjust.
- **Start a blog/news section:** Publish weekly posts covering junk removal tips, project highlights, and seasonal clean-up guides. Target long-tail keywords and link internally.
- **Collect more reviews:** Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews on Google, Yelp, and Facebook. Display these reviews on the site.
- **Social media engagement:** Regularly post before-and-after photos, customer testimonials, and seasonal promotions on Facebook and Instagram. Invite followers to share and tag friends.

## Future Enhancements

- **Online booking system:** Integrate a scheduling widget to allow customers to select a time slot and receive instant confirmation.
- **Live chat support:** Add a chat widget (or chatbot) for quick questions and to increase conversions.
- **Email marketing:** Capture emails via a subscribe form and send newsletters with tips, promotions, and reminders.

Ensure these tasks are tracked and addressed systematically to keep the site ahead of competitors and continuously improve the user experience.
